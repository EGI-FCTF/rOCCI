rOCCI was designed and is mainly developed by Florian Feldhaus (GWDG) and Piotr Kasprzak (GWDG) in Germany.

Special thanks to the following extraordinary individuals, who-out which rOCCI would not be possible:

* Hayati Bice - who wrote the initial version of an OCCI server rOCCI is based on
* Max GÃ¼nther - who wrote the EC2 backend
* Andre Thevapalan - for his input regarding the JSON rendering
* the OCCI Working Group - for developing OCCI
